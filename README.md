# Select-unselect
Print the given matrix. 

Print box for each 1 and nothing for 0. 

If any box is not selected, and the user clicks on it the box color should change and the user should not be able to unselect it again. Even if the user clicks on the box nothing should happen.

Once the user selects all the boxes, the boxes should start getting unselected in the same order the user had selected. While the unselection process is in progress, the user should not be able to click any of the boxes, or if he clicks, nothing should happen.
